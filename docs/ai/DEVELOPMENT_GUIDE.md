# DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE

## Workflow for a new format

1. Survey: dump samples to `out/` (git-ignored) or a scratch dir, inventory structure.
2. Write the reader in `tools/<format>.py` with a synthetic-data test in `tools/test_<format>.py`.
3. Verify locally against every matching object in `<UT99_DIR>`; record the counts in the spec.
4. Write `docs/formats/<format>.md`; mark anything not verified; update [coverage.md](../formats/coverage.md).
5. Update SYSTEM_SUMMARY and add a PROJECT_MEMORY stage.
6. C++ port (when the engine needs it): module in `engine/`, tests, row in boundaries.

## Quality bar

- Tests and doc checks from the [SYSTEM_SUMMARY commands](SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md#commands) pass.
- A reader change still parses every retail package (run the reader over `<UT99_DIR>` locally).

## Commits

- Imperative subject, body says why. One topic per commit; code and the docs it affects together.

## Doc-sync

| When you change | Update |
|---|---|
| A format reader | its `docs/formats/*.md`, coverage, SYSTEM_SUMMARY contracts |
| Files or folders in the tree | SYSTEM_SUMMARY tree |
| A roadmap phase's state | SYSTEM_SUMMARY, README |
| A hard rule or stack choice | new ADR, ARCHITECTURE_NOTES, AGENTS.md |
| A module or its dependencies | [boundaries.md](../architecture/boundaries.md), SYSTEM_SUMMARY tree |
| A risk or open question | `docs/roadmap/debt.md` |
